# Project Name
NHL Team-Roster

# Overview
NHL Team-Rost is a CRUD app built with React and Next.js that allows users to build their own NHL team.

# Features

- Create players with their name, position, team, and assign them to be a captain or not.
- View all of the players at once or view the teams and the players on that team.
- Edit and delete any player or team and when a user deletes a team, the players on that team will be deleted too.
- User authentication which will prevent anyone else from viewing your team.
